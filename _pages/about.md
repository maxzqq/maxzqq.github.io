HiðŸ‘‹, my name is Qi Zhang (å¼ æ£‹) I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at Computer & Information Sciences Department of Temple University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Eduard Dragut](https://cis.temple.edu/~edragut/index.htm). I also closely work with [Dr. Cornelia Caragea](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~cornelia/) and [Dr. Longin Jan Latecki](https://cis.temple.edu/~latecki/index.php).

My primary research interests are centered around Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning (ML). 
Specifically, I am working on developing information extraction models under low-resource scenarios using cost-effective techniques such as weak/distant supervision, semi-supervised learning, and in-context learning.

I am/was the research assistant for several NSF funded projects, including:
- [Extracting and Linking AI Artifacts](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2107213&HistoricalAwards=false)
- [Knowledge Graph to Support Evaluation and Development of Climate Models](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2333789&HistoricalAwards=false)
- [America's Fourth Estate at Risk: A System for
Mapping the (Local) Journalism Life Cycle to Rebuild the Nation's News Trust](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2137846)
